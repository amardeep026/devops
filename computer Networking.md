# Computer Networking OSI 
![OSI layer ](./OSI%20layer.png)
For successful communication between computers/Networks OSI model (Open system interconnection ) was organised by ISO in 1984
1. Application Layer: App layer protocals eg smtp, ftp, smtp, Outlook, Skype, virtual Terminal- telnet
All Networking application uses App Layer, 

2. Presentation Layer: Receives data from App layer in  form of characters and Numbers. 
- Presentation layer converts them to machine understandable binary foramt.
- Eg. Conversion of ASCII to FCD (Fixed Character Display) code, 
- Before data is transmitted Presentation layer reduces number of bits used to represent data called as data compression. 
- Data compression reduces amount of space to save files helps in data transfer faster. Helpful in audio and video data. 
- To mantain integrity of data before transmission data is encrypted at sender side and at receiver side data is decrypted. 
- SSL (secure Socket Layer ) is used in presntation for Encryption & Decryption
>**Presenatation layer performs three functions: Translation, Data Compression, Encryption**

3. Session layer 
- Helps in setting up and managing connections enabling sending and receiving of data followed by termination of connection and sessions. 
- Session layer has its own APIs eg NETBIOS  allows application on different computers. 
- Before connection is establesh Authentication is performed. once username and password are matched user is authenticated after that autherization is checked. These are performed by session layer.
- Session layer keeps tracks of files being downloaded. 
- When we open a website on web browser, it opens a sessions with web server to download text and images from webserver these are stored in data packets.
- Session layer keeps track which data packet belongs to which file eg text or image packet.
>Session Layer helps in session Management, Authentication and authorization. Examples: Sessions in remote procedure calls (RPC), and protocols like SMB, NFS.

**Web browser performs all functions of App, Presenataion and Session layer **

4. Transport Layer: Controlls reliability of communication
through Segmentation, flow controll, error controll

-  Segmentation: Data received from session layer is divided into small data units called segments.Each segment contains a source, destination port no. and sequnce number.
- Port No. helps to direct each segment to the application. 
- Sequence number: Helps to re-assemble in the correct order to form correct message at the receiver. 
- Eg. Mobile processind data at 10 Mbps is connected to server which process data at 100Mbps. Mobile phone with help of Transport layer tells server to send data at 10 Mbps to prevent data loss. 
- Transport layer also helps in error controll. If data doesnt reach destination or it re-transmits loss through checksum.
Protocal: TCP: connecton oriented , UDP: Connection less without any feedback.
UDP:Games,online streaming, VOIP, 
Examples: TCP, UDP, and ports.
>**Transport layer is involded in Segmentation, Flow control, Error Control.Examples: TCP, UDP, and ports.**

5. Network Layer : Transport layer passes data segments to Network layer.
- Data units in Network layer called packets. 
it involves logical addressing : IP (Each packet has sender & receiver IP Address ) and Mask 
- Path Determination: Choosing best possible path for data delivery for sorce to destination. L3 devices use porotocal BGP, OSPF
6. Data Link Layer : Receives data packet from Network Layer
- Adress type: 
  - Logical Adressing : sender & receive IP done at Network Layer 
  - Physical Address:   MAC adress to each data packet is assigned in the form of frame.
- Data unit in data link layer is called frame.
- Data link layer allows upper link layer access media using frame. 
>Media acess controll method controlls transmison.Examples: Switches, MAC addresses, and protocols like Ethernet and PPP.
7. Physical Layer:
- Converts binary seguence  into signal and transmits over local media. It can be electrical in copper/Lan cable, light signal in case of optical fibre, radio signal in case of air. 
- Signal generated by physical layer depends on type of device  
>Examples: Ethernet cables, hubs, and physical network interfaces.
