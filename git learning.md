# Git and Github
- Git is a version control system that allows you to manage the history of your code, track changes to your files and to collaborate with others. Version control systems are essential for software development.

## Git and Github are different

Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to your files. It is a free and open-source software that is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember, GIT is a software and can be installed on your computer.

Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Github is an online platform that allows you to store and share your code with others.

### Repository
A repository is a collection of files and directories that are stored together.like a folder on your computer, but it is more than just a folder
>git folder is hidden folder

## Commands
git add . (or filename )
git log 
git log --oneline

## git ignore file : will not save files mentioned in it but git ignore will be tracked.
eg .env file, api keys, payment gateweay for TF =  *.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
*.tfvars
GIT doesnt keep track of empty folder
to track empty folder but needed in future we .gitkeep file 

# Branches
git branch - This command lists all the branches in the current repository.
git branch bug-fix - This command creates a new branch called bug-fix.
git switch bug-fix - This command switches to the bug-fix branch.
git log - This command shows the commit history for the current branch.
git switch master - This command switches to the master branch.
git switch -c dark-mode - This command creates a new branch called dark-mode. the -c flag is used to create a new branch.
git checkout orange-mode - This command switches to the orange-mode branch.
Commit before switching to a branch
Go to .git folder and checkout to the HEAD file
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name> # branch rename 
git branch -d <branch-name> # delete branch 
git ls-tree --name-only HEAD # to list files in branch

###### Stash is a way to save your changes in a temporary location. It is useful when you want to make changes to a file but donâ€™t want to commit them yet. You can then come back to the file later and apply the changes.
git stash
git stash save "work in progress on X feature"
git stash list
###### Tags are a way to mark a specific point in your repository. They are useful when you want to remember a specific version of your code or when you want to refer to a specific commit.
git tag <tag-name>
git tag -a messaged -m "testing tag" b55bf3d

## remote Repo

git push -u origin main  # to check remote repos origin is considered as remote repo
git remote add origin git@github.com:amardeep026/devops.git   # setup remote linking 
git rm --cached config.yml # (then do commit, without add .) remove file remotely but will be present locally
